Hi, my name is Eric, and I'm
a Service Canada employee.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.840
You may have heard the old saying

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.560
that when you're out of work, finding
a job is your full-time occupation.

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.460
Well, there's a lot of truth to that.

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.260
Finding a job does take time and effort.

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.120
But don't get discouraged,
there are a number of online tools

7
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.400
and programs available
to help you find a job.

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.660
No matter what you're looking for,
there are many websites where employers

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.380
post job notices looking for people
to fill vacant positions.

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.380
One of these sites is called Job Bank.

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.240
It's updated every day and lists job

12
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.060
opportunities that are
available across the country.

13
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.140
Since the job ads on Job Bank are updated
daily, you should check them regularly,

14
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.140
and you can search for jobs
posted in the last 48 hours.

15
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.760
On Job Bank, you can also advertise your
skills and even ask them to send you

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.020
emails when jobs that match your
search criteria are posted.

17
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.920
If you're thinking about working
in the public sector, jobs.

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.360
Gc.

19
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.620
Ca is the official website for Government
of Canada listings open to the public.

20
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.040
Keep in mind that some departments,

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.980
like the Canada Revenue Agency and Parks
Canada, post jobs on their own sites too.

22
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.260
When you apply for jobs,

23
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.900
potential employers might ask you to send
them your resume and covering letter.

24
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.130
Of course, you want to make a good first
impression on any potential employer.

25
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.490
Here we can help too.

26
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.020
Check out our online resume
builder on the Job Bank website.

27
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.720
It can show you how to create a first

28
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.740
class resume by giving you tips
and different layout options.

29
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.160
And if you're not sure which jobs you'd

30
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.080
like to apply for,
check out our career navigator tool

31
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.850
to explore occupations that you
might be interested in.

32
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480
As well,
career counselors are usually available

33
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.100
through your provincial or
territorial government to help out.

34
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520
At Service Canada,
we're people, serving people.
